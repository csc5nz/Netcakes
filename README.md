Netcakes offers customized cakes shipped directly to the customer without
having to visit, order or pick up at a physical location or bakery. Customers are able to build their cakes choosing from multiple customization options, and then pay using Bitcoin. Once the cakes are ordered the bakery bakes the cakes and delivers them directly to the customer's door.
